Yep. For OSX, open Terminal and run:

$ open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security
For Linux run:

$ google-chrome --disable-web-security
Also if you're trying to access local files for dev purposes like AJAX or JSON, you can use this flag too.

-â€“allow-file-access-from-files
For Windows go into the command prompt and go into the folder where Chrome.exe is and type

chrome.exe --disable-web-security
That should disable the same origin policy and allow you to access local files.

Update: For Chrome 22+ you will be presented with an error message that says:

You are using an unsupported command-line flag: --disable-web-security. Stability and security will suffer.

However you can just ignore that message while developing.
